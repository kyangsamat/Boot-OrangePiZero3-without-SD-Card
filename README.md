*This only works on the official images Ubuntu and Debian of the Orange Pi Zero 3.

- Enter the FEL mode and flash the U-Boot to the SPI On a Linux Computer.
- Download the fel-sdboot.sunxi file and write the "magic binary" to the SD Card using balenaEtcher or recording on SD Card using the command.

```javascript
sudo dd if=fel-sdboot.sunxi of=/dev/sdb bs=1k seek=8
```

- Output :

```javascript

8192 bytes (8.2 kB, 8.0 KiB) copied, 0.0585641 s, 140 kB/s
```

- Download the [Sunxi-tools](https://linux-sunxi.org/Sunxi-tools) from [https://linux-sunxi.org/Sunxi-tools](https://linux-sunxi.org/Sunxi-tools)  -â€“ Usually it shipped with the package of Linux.
- Download the u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin to the computer
- Then insert the SD Card into the Orange Pi Zero 3 and connect it to a computer using the USB-C (USB0) of the Orange Pi Zero 3 and run the following command in the terminal. It should give a return if the Orange Pi Zero 3 is detected and in FEL mode.

```javascript
sudo sunxi-fel version
```

- Then run this command to write the u-boot.

```javascript
sunxi-fel -v -p spiflash-write 0 u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin
```

- It shoud return with

```javascript
100% [=============================] 828 kB, 69.6 kB/s
```

- And it's done.
